## Idea ##

Very often, when I aim to solve problem A, I get stuck and have to solve problem
B, and then problem C, ...

It's easy for me to forget the stack. So this simple script is for me to be a
task stack in order not to forget anything in between, or lose the original
purpose.

The argument is pop, last, count, and anything else will be a new task
description.
